###App Overview
This app gives a visual introduction and explanation of the Tipi&#7789;aka's 50 volumes as well as the commentaries and subcommentaries about the Tipi&#7789;aka.  

The volumes and commentaries are layed out on virtual bookshelves with clickable books to get more information about each volume or work.  

A menu will also allow you to select whole sections (i.e. the whole suttanta or vinaya) or quickly locate popular volumes such as the _Dhammapada_ or _J&#257;taka Tales_ to see where they occur in the whole Tipitaka or such as the _The Path of Purification_ in the commentaries.

The app will also come with an animated short introduction to the Tipi&#7789;aka that can be started with the click of a button.
